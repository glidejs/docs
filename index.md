[[lead]]Glide.js is a dependency-free JavaScript ES6 slider and carousel. It’s lightweight, flexible and fast. Designed to slide. No less, no more[[/lead]]

[[example dir=intro]]

### Dependency-free

Everything on board, ready for action. Written in vanilla JavaScript without hidden dependencies.

### Lightweight

The modular structure provides excellent compression. Oh yes, it weights only **~[[filesize file=node_modules/@glidejs/glide/dist/glide.min.js]]kb (~[[gzipsize file=node_modules/@glidejs/glide/dist/glide.min.js]]kb gzipped)** with every functionality included.

### Modular

Need a few selected modules? Remove unused modules and drop overall script weight even more.

[Learn about modular build →](/docs/setup#using-es-modules)

### Bundlers ready

Modern setup? Using Rollup or Webpack? We have your back.

[Learn more in setup documentation →](/docs/setup#npm)

### Extendable

Need something more custom-made? Plug-in your own modules with additional functionalities.
